This calculator project was developed as a group effort, providing basic arithmetic operations in Python

****The calculator program performs the following operations:**
- Addition: Addition is an arithmetic operation that combines two or more numbers to find their total or sum. When adding numbers, the order of the numbers does not change the result. Addition is denoted by the "+" symbol.
For example: - 3 + 2 =  5 
 
- Subtraction:Subtraction is an arithmetic operation that finds the difference between two numbers. It represents the operation of taking away one quantity from another. The result of subtraction is called the difference. Subtraction is denoted by the "-" symbol.
For example: - 10 - 5 =  5
 
- Multiplication:Multiplication is an arithmetic operation that combines two or more numbers to find their product. It is a shortcut way of adding a number to itself multiple times. Multiplication is denoted by the "×" symbol or by using an asterisk "*" symbol.
For example: - 4 × 5 = 20 - 2 × 3 × 4 = 24

- Division:Division is an arithmetic operation that splits a quantity into equal parts or determines how many times one number is contained within another. It involves dividing a dividend by a divisor to find the quotient. Division is denoted by the "÷" symbol or by using a forward slash "/" symbol.
For example: - 12 ÷ 3 = 4 - 25 ÷ 5 = 5
Note that division by zero is undefined and generally not allowed.
